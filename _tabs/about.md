## Welcome to my blog

I'm Dennis and im 39 years old living in Sweden, I currently work as a IT Consultant with Identity and Access management building stuff out of PowerShell as a self employed / freelancer. 

So the topics being covered in this blog will start with Identity topics in Entra ID and will probably cover PowerShell since I like to automate stuff with it.

This is hosted on an Azure storage account as a static webpage with an Azure CDN in front of it.

If you want to get in contact with me you have some social links down to the left.
